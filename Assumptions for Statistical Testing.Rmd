## Research questions and corresponding statistical tests


The most popular research questions include:

1. whether two variables (n = 2) are correlated (i.e., associated)

*Ans:* Correlation test between two variables

2. whether multiple variables (n > 2) are correlated

*Ans:* Correlation matrix between multiple variables

3. whether two groups (n = 2) of samples differ from each other

*Ans:* Comparing the means of two groups:

        -  Student's t-test (parametric)
        -  Wilcoxon rank test (non-parametric)
        
4. whether multiple groups (n >= 2) of samples differ from each other

*Ans:* Comparing the means of more than two groups

    - ANOVA test (analysis of variance, parametric): extension of t-test to compare more than two groups.
    - Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (non-parametric): extension of Wilcoxon rank test to compare more than two groups


## Tesing of variablility

5. whether the variability of two samples differ

*Ans:* Comparing the variances:

     - Comparing the variances of two groups: F-test (parametric)
     - Comparison of the variances of more than two groups: Bartlett's test (parametric), Levene's test (parametric)
     -and Fligner-Killeen test (non-parametric)


## Statistical test requirements

Many of the statistical procedures including correlation, regression, t-test, and analysis of variance assume some certain characteristic about the data. Generally they assume that:

- **the data are normally distributed,**
- **and the variances of the groups to be compared are homogeneous (equal)**

These assumptions should be taken seriously to draw reliable interpretation and conclusions of the research. These tests - correlation, t-test and ANOVA - are called parametric tests, because their validity depends on the distribution of the data.


## Pretest for statistical testing

- For large samples, parametric test can be used

- Use **Shapiro-Wilk's** significance test comparing the sample distribution to a normal one in order to ascertain whether data show or not a serious deviation from normality

## A simple trick to attain normality!!

A statistically acceptable trick is to form a large ($n>100$) sample for analysis. The rest is with your statistical analysis tool. 


##  Normality Test in R

Normality and the other assumptions made by parametric tests should be taken seriously to draw reliable interpretation and conclusions of the research.

### Packages required

- *dplyr* for data manipulation

- *ggpubr*  for an easy ggplot2-based data visualization

## Example

Choose the ToothGrowth data and test for normality:

```{r}
# Store the data in the variable my_data
my_data <- ToothGrowth
set.seed(1234)
dplyr::sample_n(my_data, 10)

```

 For large sample these pretests are laxuaries.However, to be consistent, normality can be checked by visual inspection [normal plots (histogram), Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot)] or by significance tests].


## Normality test

*Approach*:  Use a significance test comparing the sample distribution to a normal one in order to ascertain whether data show or not a serious deviation from normality.

There are several methods for normality test such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) normality test and Shapiro-Wilk's test. The null hypothesis of these tests is that "sample distribution is normal". If the test is significant, the distribution is non-normal.

```{r}
shapiro.test(my_data$len)
```

**Info**: From the output, the p-value > 0.05 implying that the distribution of the data are not significantly different from normal distribution. In other words, we can assume the normality.


##Visual methods
Density plot and Q-Q plot can be used to check normality visually.

### Density Plot

```{r}
library("ggpubr")
ggdensity(my_data$len, 
          main = "Density plot of tooth length",
          xlab = "Tooth length")
```

## Q-Q Plot

```{r}
ggqqplot(my_data$len)
```

## qqPlot()

It's also possible to use the function qqPlot() [in car package]:

```{r}
library("car")
qqPlot(my_data$len)
```


## Takeaway from the session

-Always form good research questions and hypothesis for analysis.

- In case of parametric tests, always make sure that the group of data to be analyzed follows normal distribution.

- If normality can not be maintained, then try non- parametric tests.

- Always use large samples for statistical analysis.
